Introduction

In these days of daily political drama, it's important to stay up to date!  This handy app is just the thing - it will show you the key stories from The Guardian, and then give you a quick summary of each story, along with a link to the full article.

This is a one-page app created using only Javascript, HTML and CSS.  It is tested using our custom-made JS test suite.  It is also responsive to screen size.


Instructions
----

Download and run the app:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:malinnaleach/news-summary.git
$ cd news-summary
$ open newsmaker.html
```

To run the test suite:
```
Open newsmaker.html in you code editor of choice
Comment out line 20
Un-comment lines 21 - 24
